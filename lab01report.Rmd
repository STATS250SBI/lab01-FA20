## Lab Tutorial

### Getting Started: What is R?
In Statistics, we often use computers to analyze data. There are a lot of programs that can help you do statistical analyses. One of the most popular (and powerful) is called R. R is a "statistical computing environment" that is designed for manipulating data, doing calculations, and making graphical displays. R works by writing **R code**.

That might sound scary, but *don't worry*: this is not a programming class. Over the course of the semester, you'll learn how to edit and write some basic R code to help you analyze data to answer research questions. Our goal in lab is to help you learn the basics of R and R coding, but through the lens of answering statistical questions.

#### What are all these "R" terms?
There are a lot of "R" words floating around. What's going on?

- *R* is a "statistical computing environment" that's designed for manipulating data, generating plots, and performing analyses. It's also a programming language. You'll be *using R* this semester.
- *R Studio* is an "integrated development environment (IDE)" for R (you'll never have to hear the term IDE again in this class). Basically, it's a pretty interface that makes working with R easier. You use R inside of R Studio. If R is ice cream, R Studio is the cone or cup.
- *R Markdown* is a way to write pretty analysis reports that combines R code, R output (plots, analysis results, etc.) and text in one document. This lab document is an R Markdown report!

### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. R Markdown lets you combine text, R code, and plots in one pretty, reproducible report. If you're curious about this, you can find more details on using R Markdown at <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

R Markdown runs code contained in "chunks". A chunk looks like this:
```{r helloWorld}
print("Hello world!")
```
Notice that the code, `print("Hello world!")` is contained between three backticks (```, right below the esc key on a US English keyboard) -- this is how R Markdown knows where your chunks start and stop. You can just run a single chunk by clicking the green "play" button in the upper right corner of the chunk.

When you click the **Knit** button in R Studio, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

#### Tips for R Markdown
1. **Knit and knit often**: Frequently knitting your document will help you make sure that all your code works and that the document looks the way you want.
1. **Don't be afraid to experiment**: Nobody gets things exactly right the first time, and we all forget how things work sometimes. Keep trying, and you'll eventually get what you want!
1. **Formatting**: You can make text **bold** by surrounding it with two asterisks (`**`) and *italic* by surrounding it with one asterisk (`*`).

### Using R as a Calculator
At it's most basic, R is a fancy calculator. 

Remember, you can run the code in this chunk by clicking the green "play" button in the upper right corner of the chunk.
```{r calculatorExample}
5 * 7
```
When you run the chunk, you'll see a `[1]` before the output of `35`. *Just ignore this. The result is `35`.*

**Try it yourself!**
In the chunk below, compute 50 divided by 9. You'll notice the chunk contains the text `# Write code here!`. This is called a "comment" -- it's not code that R runs, it's just there to explain your code. Feel free to delete and replace it, or start a new line and type there. See what happens!
```{r tryItCalculator, error = T}
# Write code here! This text is a comment, so it's not run by R. Replace it with code to compute 50 divided by 9.
```


### Palmer Penguins Data
We're going to start by working with a data set with data on 333 penguins collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipeligo in Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php)
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), and the data were prepared by [Dr. Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins).

![Illustration of penguin species. Artwork by @allison_horst.](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)

**TODO: Make codebook**

We'll talk more about the specifics of this next week, but for now know that this is creating a data set called `penguins`, and the data is coming from the URL (Web address/link) in the innermost parentheses.

```{r readData}
penguins <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS250SBI/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins_NArm.csv"))
```

Let's see what's in the data. We can peek at the first few (6, specifically) rows of the data using the `head()` function:
```{r headPenguins}
head(penguins)
```
We read that line as "*head* of *penguins*". Remember that `penguins` is what we named our data set. We can see that `penguins` contains a number of *variables*, like `species`, `island`, and more.

### Bar Charts in R
Let's explore our `penguins` data by making a plot that will help us visualize a categorical variable. We'll start by looking at the number of penguins observed of each species.

```{r speciesPlot}
barplot(table(penguins$species),
     xlab = "Species",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Bar Chart of Number of Penguins of Each Species Observed",
     col = c("darkorange1", "mediumorchid2", "darkcyan"))
```

Over the course of the semester, we'll talk in more depth about the "arguments" to this "function" (e.g., `xlab`, `ylab`, etc.) and how we can use them to manipulate the graphs we make.

### Numerical Summaries
In addition to analyzing data visually, we can also use R to summarize data numerically. We'll use the `summary()` function to do that for a given variable. Here, we'll summarize the `flipper_length_mm` variable, which is the length of the penguins' flippers (in millimeters). 

```{r flipperSummaries}
summary(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```

R gives us 6 numbers: the minimum (shortest) flipper length, the first quartile, the median (middle) flipper length, the mean (average) flipper length, the third quartile, and the maximum (longest) flipper length. We'll talk about each of these in more detail later in the course!

## Try It!
Depending on your instruction method (in person, synchronous remote, asynchronous remote), complete the following exercises collaboratively. 

1. **In person:** Form groups of 2-4 with those around you (maintaining physical distance). Your instructor will provide additional details.
1. **Synchronous remote:** You will be placed in a Zoom breakout room to work together in small groups. 
1. **Asynchronous remote:** Join a Piazza lab group for asynchronous collaboration. **TODO: FIGURE THIS OUT, PROVIDE DIRECT LINKS**


**Collaborators:** Replace this text with the names of anyone you collaborated with on this project.

> **1.** Which of the variables in `penguins` are *quantitative* (or *numeric*) and which are *categorical*?

*Answer:*  Replace this text with your answer.


> **2.** Make a bar chart for the number of penguins observed on each island in the Palmer Archipelago. You will need to use the `islands` variable in the `penguins` data set. *Hint: you can use existing code from above, and be sure to change the axis labels and title too!* \n
If you have time, play around with the colors! (things like "red", "yellow", "blue" work, but see [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) for a list of possible color names in R if you're more adventurous.)

```{r islandPlot}
# Get started by copying and pasting the code from the speciesPlot chunk above! (Remember that this text is a comment, so it's not run by R; you can delete it if you want.)
```

> **3.** Recreate the numerical summaries for the `bill_length_mm` variable. (*Hint: copy/paste and alter the code from earlier.*) What is the mean (average) bill length?

```{r billSummaries}
# Get started by copying and pasting the code from the flipperSummaries chunk above! (Remember that this text is a comment, so it's not run by R; you can delete it if you want.)
```

*Answer:* Replace this text with your answer to the question about mean bill length.

## Discussion
Each week, this section of the lab will have you dive deeper into the analysis. Maybe you'll discuss a different application, or preview the next week's topic. You'll also have the chance to draw substantive conclusions from your analysis, and to think more deeply about what it is you've just done, and why. *Often, there will not be right or wrong answers here, just like in real-life applications of statistics. These questions are meant to make you think more deeply about what you've just done.*

> Talk About It 1: What's something you learned today? It can be about statistics, R, penguins, or anything else related to STATS 250.

*Write 1-2 sentences about your answer here*

> Talk About It 2: How do you think statistics can help you in your major or future career?

*Write 1-2 sentences about your answer here*

> Talk About It 3: What was the best part of lab for you today? What was a challenging part?

*Write 1-2 sentences about your answer here*
